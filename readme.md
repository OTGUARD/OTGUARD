# The OTGUARD Paper

We sufficiently gave files and folders in this repository descriptive names to allow for easy understanding for our reviewers.

Due to size restrictions in github, we cannot include actual snapshot files. However, we provided the verbose output of parsing each snapshot based on the Windbg Windows tool. 

code/forensic_analysis/process_core.ps1 is the main code that parses the snapshots. The verbose running is captured in windbg.log. The can be seen in the Stuxnet-type experiments in SNAPSHOTS_DATA/STUXNET_EXPERIMENT/snapshotX/windbg.log
